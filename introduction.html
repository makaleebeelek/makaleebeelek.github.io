        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        I am currently studying at Utah State University as an undergraduate
        seeking my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I am set to graduate
        December 2021. I currently work as a Free-lance Graphic Designer
        and have been doing so for about 5 years.  Creative Juice Graphic
        Designs is the name I work under and the above logo is my personal logo.
        I am skilled in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Android Studio,
        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Indesign, and Adobe Photoshop.
