    </h3>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Makalee Beelek! I enjoy reading, video gaming, programming,
        knitting, and playing board games. My favorite food is <b>watermelon.</b>
        Among some of my favorite board games include <u>Clue, Ticket to Ride,
        Telestrations, and Snake Oil.</u> My absolute favorite video game is
        <span style="color:green">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.</span> My
        favorite book is <mark>Everneath by Brodi Ashton.</mark> The above pictured
        hat was designed and knitted by me to look like the <small>Pokemon Magikarp</small>
        (similar to a Koi fish) was stuck on my head.
